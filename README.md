# Pokemon Blackjack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This was a group project created with Kirsten Hattori, Morgan Lloyd, and Jeriel Garcia.

## How to Play
On game start, each player is drawn two cards. The goal of the game is to either reach a total sum of card values of 21, or have a score closest to 21 without going over. On each round, players could either draw a card and add it to their current hand or stand to pass to skip their turn.
